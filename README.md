This project was carried out as part of a project discipline at the University of Minho (LI3), in the second year of the 
integrated master degree in informatics engineering.

This work aims to develop a system capable of processing XML files that store the various informations used by Stack Overflow. 
Once this information has been processed, it is intended to be able to execute a specific set of questions (presented later) 
in an efficient way.

The same project is developed in C and JAVA, with each part in its respective folder.

Made with Diogo Braga - (https://github.com/diogofbraga) and Jo√£o Silva - (https://github.com/joaop21).
